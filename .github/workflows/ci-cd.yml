name: FileConverter CI/CD Pipeline

# Workflow Description:
# This workflow performs cross-platform testing and integration for the FileConverter project.
# It runs whenever code is pushed to the roo branch or a PR is created targeting main.
# If all tests pass, changes from roo are automatically merged into main.

    branches: [ roo ]

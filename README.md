For a detailed architecture overview, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

### Setup Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsgfulfillment/fileconverter.git
   cd fileconverter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,gui]"
   ```

4. Alternative simplified installation:

   If you encounter issues with the standard installation, use the installation helper script:

   ```bash
   # Quick installation and test
   python install_and_test.py
   
   # Or run the tests to verify your setup
   python direct_test.py
   ```

### Adding New Converters

To add support for a new file format:

1. Create a new module in the `fileconverter/converters` directory
2. Implement a converter class that inherits from `BaseConverter`
3. Register input and output formats
4. Implement the conversion logic

Example structure:

```python
from fileconverter.core.registry import BaseConverter

class MyFormatConverter(BaseConverter):
    @classmethod
    def get_input_formats(cls):
        return ["format1", "format2"]
    
    @classmethod
    def get_output_formats(cls):
        return ["format3", "format4"]
    
    @classmethod
    def get_format_extensions(cls, format_name):
        if format_name == "format1":
            return ["fmt1", "f1"]
        # ...
    
    def convert(self, input_path, output_path, temp_dir, parameters):
        # Implement conversion logic
        return {
            "input_format": "format1",
            "output_format": "format3",
            # ...
        }
    
    def get_parameters(self):
        return {
            "format3": {
                "quality": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Output quality",
                    "default": 85,
                    "min": 1,
                    "max": 100
                },
                # ...
            }
        }
```

For detailed documentation, see [Adding New Converters](docs/development/adding_converters.md).

### Testing

FileConverter uses pytest for testing. To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=fileconverter

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_core.py
pytest tests/test_converters/

# Test the GUI launcher
python test_launcher.py

# Test installation and setup
python direct_test.py
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with installation or launching the GUI:

1. **Installation Issues**:
   - Try the direct installation script: `python install_and_test.py`
   - Install dependencies manually: `pip install PyQt6 Pillow pyyaml click`
   - Check error messages for missing dependencies

2. **GUI Launch Issues**:
   - Use the direct launcher: `python launch_gui.py`
   - Verify PyQt6 is installed: `pip install PyQt6`
   - Run the test script: `python test_launcher.py`
   - Check if the icon is generated: `python -c "from fileconverter.gui.resources.icon_generator import generate_icon; generate_icon()"`

3. **Path Issues**:
   - If commands like `fileconverter` or `fileconverter-gui` aren't found, verify your Python Scripts directory is in your PATH
   - On Windows: Add `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts` to your PATH
   - On Linux/macOS: Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH

### CI/CD Pipeline

FileConverter uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline provides comprehensive testing and automatic deployments.

#### How the Workflow Works

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs when:
   - Code is pushed to the `roo` branch
   - A pull request is created targeting the `main` branch

2. **Test Execution Process**:
   - Tests run in parallel across all configured platforms and Python versions
   - Each test phase must pass for the workflow to succeed
   - Results and logs are saved as artifacts for later review
   - A test summary is generated for quick overview of results

3. **Test Requirements**:
   - **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage required
   - **All Test Types**: Unit, integration, installation, and dependency tests must pass
   - **Cross-Platform**: Tests must pass on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu

#### Test Suite Components

- **Phase 1: Unit Tests with Coverage**
  - Runs all unit tests with code coverage measurement
  - Enforces 80% minimum code coverage
  - Generates coverage reports in XML and terminal formats

- **Phase 2: Cross-Platform Integration Tests**
  - Executes the comprehensive test suite with `run_tests.py`
  - Tests core functionality across all platforms
  - Generates detailed logs of test execution

- **Phase 3: Installation Testing**
  - Validates the package installation process
  - Tests entry points, shortcut creation, and executable generation
  - Ensures environment variables and paths are correctly set

- **Phase 4: Dependency Management Testing**
  - Tests the dependency detection and installation system
  - Validates offline installation capabilities
  - Checks platform-specific dependency handling

#### Artifacts and Logs

- Detailed logs are generated for each test phase
- Test logs, coverage reports, and execution results are saved as artifacts
- Artifacts are attached to each workflow run for easy access and debugging

#### Automatic Deployment

- If all tests pass on the `roo` branch, changes are automatically merged to `main`
- Merge commits include [CI] tag for easy identification
- The `main` branch always contains stable, fully tested code
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `roo`: Development branch where all contributions should be targeted
  - `main`: Stable release branch (don't submit PRs directly to main)

Contributors should:
1. Create feature branches from `roo`
2. Submit PRs targeting the `roo` branch
3. Wait for CI tests to complete successfully
4. Address any test failures before changes can be merged

The CI pipeline runs all tests with the `--no-gui` flag to ensure compatibility in non-GUI environments.

<file path="Development-plan.md">
Below is a detailed step‐by‐step plan that outlines the initial setup and requirements gathering for a Python script that can convert various file types—from Word and Excel to PDF and plain text. Since the repository is currently very minimal (only a global cursor-tools rule file), we’ll start by establishing a new project structure and setting down our requirements. The plan also provides multiple options where applicable, so you can later decide what fits best.

────────────────────────────
1. Define the Requirements and Scope

• Goal: Develop a Python script or command‐line tool that converts files between common formats such as:
  – Microsoft Word formats: .doc, .docx
  – Microsoft Excel formats: .xls, .xlsx
  – PDF
  – Plain text (.txt)
  – (Optionally) Other variants (CSV, RTF, etc.)

• Functional Requirements:
  – The tool should accept one or multiple file inputs.
  – It should detect the file type (either from extension or optionally by file signature).
  – It should convert to a target format, for example:
    Word ➔ PDF, PDF ➔ Word, Excel ➔ CSV, etc.
  – Provide logging and error handling for unsupported conversions.
  – Use a clean command-line interface (CLI) with options for source file(s), destination format (and maybe destination path).

• Non-Functional Requirements:
  – Use widely available Python libraries (pip installable).
  – Apply modular design for each file type conversion, making it easy to extend.
  – Provide clear documentation and usage examples.
  – Ensure cross-platform compatibility.

────────────────────────────
2. Choose Libraries and Tools

Since conversion algorithms differ per file type, decide on packages for each conversion:

• Word Document Conversion:
  – For reading/editing Word: python-docx (pip: python-docx)
  – For converting DOCX to PDF: Options include third-party libraries (e.g., docx2pdf)
    Option A: Use docx2pdf (only works on Windows/Mac with MS Word installed on Windows or a similar mechanism)
    Option B: Convert using LibreOffice headless conversion (via subprocess)

• Excel Document Conversion:
  – For reading/writing Excel: openpyxl (pip: openpyxl) or xlrd/xlwt (for older .xls forms)
  – Possibly use pandas (pip: pandas) for more generic file handling (Excel to CSV conversion)

• PDF Manipulation:
  – Use PyPDF2 (pip: PyPDF2) for reading PDF content.
  – For PDF to text conversion, consider pdfminer.six (pip: pdfminer.six) or PyMuPDF (pip: PyMuPDF)
  – Converting text to PDF could be done with ReportLab (pip: reportlab)

• Plain Text:
  – Use Python’s built-in file handling for reading and writing text files.

• CLI and Utility:
  – Use argparse (standard library) for the command-line interface.
  – Optionally, use logging for debug and verbose output.

• Dependency Management:
  – Create a requirements.txt file listing all needed libraries.
   Example:
    docx2pdf==0.1.7
    python-docx==0.8.11
    openpyxl==3.1.2
    PyPDF2==3.0.1
    pdfminer.six==20201018
    reportlab==3.6.12
    pandas==1.5.3  (if using for Excel conversion)

────────────────────────────
3. Setup Project Structure

Assuming you want a clean project structure, consider the following layout:

Project Root (e.g., file_converter/)
├── README.md                     # Overview and usage instructions.
├── requirements.txt              # List of required packages.
├── file_converter.py             # Main CLI script.
├── converters/                   # A package for each conversion module.
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── word_converter.py         # Convert Word files to/from other formats.
│   ├── excel_converter.py        # Conversion functions for Excel.
│   ├── pdf_converter.py          # PDF conversion utilities.
│   └── text_converter.py         # Plain text conversion if needed.
└── tests/                        # Test scripts (optional for initial planning).
    └── test_conversion.py

This modular design helps in isolating conversion logic for different formats and makes it easier to add support for new file types in the future.

────────────────────────────
4. Develop an Initial Plan for the CLI Script

A sample skeleton for file_converter.py may look like:

-------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
File Converter
================
A CLI tool for converting files between different formats (Word, Excel, PDF, TXT).
"""

import argparse
import os
from converters import word_converter, excel_converter, pdf_converter, text_converter

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Convert files between formats.")
    parser.add_argument("input", help="Path to the input file", nargs='+')
    parser.add_argument("-t", "--target", required=True, choices=["pdf", "docx", "txt", "csv"],
                        help="Target file format")
    parser.add_argument("-o", "--output", help="Output directory (optional)")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Example: Process each file
    for file_path in args.input:
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' does not exist.")
            continue

        # Identify input format by file extension and call a conversion function.
        _, ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)
        ext = ext.lower()
        if ext in ['.doc', '.docx']:
            word_converter.convert(file_path, args.target, args.output)
        elif ext in ['.xls', '.xlsx']:
            excel_converter.convert(file_path, args.target, args.output)
        elif ext == '.pdf':
            pdf_converter.convert(file_path, args.target, args.output)
        elif ext == '.txt':
            text_converter.convert(file_path, args.target, args.output)
        else:
            print(f"Unsupported file format for '{file_path}'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
-------------------------

This design leaves room for:
  – Adding more detailed conversion logic.
  – Extending CLI features (like batch conversion, verbose logging, etc.).

────────────────────────────
5. Define the Functions in Each Converter Module

For instance, in converters/word_converter.py, you might start with:

-------------------------
# converters/word_converter.py

def convert(input_file, target_format, output_dir=None):
    # Pseudocode: Add conversion logic based on target_format
    if target_format == "pdf":
        # Option 1: Use docx2pdf
        from docx2pdf import convert as docx2pdf_convert
        try:
            output_path = output_dir if output_dir else ""
            docx2pdf_convert(input_file, output_path)
            print(f"Converted '{input_file}' to PDF.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error converting '{input_file}': {e}")
    elif target_format == "txt":
        # Convert Word document to plain text (using python-docx)
        try:
            from docx import Document
            doc = Document(input_file)
            text = "\n".join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])
            out_file = (output_dir + "/" if output_dir else "") + input_file.rsplit(".", 1)[0] + ".txt"
            with open(out_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(text)
            print(f"Converted '{input_file}' to TXT.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error converting '{input_file}': {e}")
    else:
        print(f"Conversion from Word to {target_format} is not supported yet.")
-------------------------

Each module (excel_converter.py, pdf_converter.py, text_converter.py) would follow a similar pattern—providing a convert() function and stubbing in logic that you can gradually extend.

────────────────────────────
6. Create a requirements.txt File

Inside requirements.txt, list your dependencies:
-------------------------
python-docx==0.8.11
docx2pdf==0.1.7
openpyxl==3.1.2
PyPDF2==3.0.1
pdfminer.six==20201018
reportlab==3.6.12
pandas==1.5.3   # (if you choose to use pandas for Excel conversion)
-------------------------

This will allow developers to run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

────────────────────────────
7. Documentation and Next Steps

• Write a README.md at the project root describing:
  – The purpose of the tool.
  – Installation instructions (e.g., creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies).
  – Usage examples.
  – Any known limitations

• Outline additional tests:
  – Consider writing unit tests in the tests/ folder using pytest or unittest.
  – Create sample input files to experiment with conversion quality.

• Decide on the conversion architecture:
  Option A: A single monolithic script (if the conversion logic is very simple).
  Option B: A modular design (as shown above) to enable future expandability.

• Identify conversion edge cases:
  – Files with unusual encoding.
  – Conversions where data loss may occur.
  – Dependency requirements (e.g., docx2pdf requires MS Word installation on some platforms).

────────────────────────────
8. Final Checklist Before Coding

• Confirm you have Python (>=3.7 recommended) installed.
• Create a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/Mac)  or  venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
• Run pip install -r requirements.txt after creating the file.
• Set up version control (initialize a git repository if necessary).
• Optionally create initial commit with README, requirements.txt, and the basic project structure.

────────────────────────────
Conclusion

This plan outlines a clear roadmap:
  1. Determine what file conversion paths to support.
  2. Select libraries and document their roles.
  3. Establish a modular project structure.
  4. Set up a basic CLI tool that routes files to conversion modules.
  5. Create scaffolding for each conversion module and a requirements file for dependency management.
  6. Prepare documentation and testing strategies.

Once this initial setup, design, and requirements are approved, you can start implementation on one component at a time. This modular, documented approach will facilitate future extensions (such as adding new formats) and provide a solid starting point for further development.
